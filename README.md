#Overview
This project is a simple Docker image that runs [Nomad](https://nomadproject.io/), saving you from having to install it.

#Prerequisites
* a working [Docker](http://docker.io) engine
* a working [Docker Compose](http://docker.io) installation

#Building
Type `docker-compose build` to build the image.

#Installation
Docker Compose will automatically install the newly built image into the cache.

#Tips and Tricks

##Launching The Image

`docker-compose up` will launch the image, proving it built correctly.  For everyday use, run `./nomad.sh`.

##Development Mode
You can run `./nomad-dual.sh` to start a Nomad agent in both client and server mode.  This will allow you 
to test your Nomad scripts without setting up an actual Nomad cluster.

##Workload Description
Nomad uses a descriptor to declare the desired workload properties. The current format can be generated by 
Nomad via `nomad init`  Here is an example of the output:


```
# There can only be a single job definition per file.
# Create a job with ID and Name 'example'
job "example" {
	# Run the job in the global region, which is the default.
	# region = "global"

	# Specify the datacenters within the region this job can run in.
	datacenters = ["dc1"]

	# Service type jobs optimize for long-lived services. This is
	# the default but we can change to batch for short-lived tasks.
	# type = "service"

	# Priority controls our access to resources and scheduling priority.
	# This can be 1 to 100, inclusively, and defaults to 50.
	# priority = 50

	# Restrict our job to only linux. We can specify multiple
	# constraints as needed.
	constraint {
		attribute = "$attr.kernel.name"
		value = "linux"
	}

	# Configure the job to do rolling updates
	update {
		# Stagger updates every 10 seconds
		stagger = "10s"

		# Update a single task at a time
		max_parallel = 1
	}

	# Create a 'cache' group. Each task in the group will be
	# scheduled onto the same machine.
	group "cache" {
		# Control the number of instances of this groups.
		# Defaults to 1
		count = 3

		# Restart Policy - This block defines the restart policy for TaskGroups,
		# the attempts value defines the number of restarts Nomad will do if Tasks
		# in this TaskGroup fails in a rolling window of interval duration
		# The delay value makes Nomad wait for that duration to restart after a Task
		# fails or crashes.
		restart {
			interval = "5m"
			attempts = 10
			delay = "25s"
		}

		# Define a task to run
		task "redis" {
			# Use Docker to run the task.
			driver = "docker"

			# Configure Docker driver with the image
			config {
				image = "redis:2.8"
				port_map {
					db = 6379
				}
			}

			service {
				name = "${TASKGROUP}-redis"
				tags = ["global", "cache"]
				port = "db"
				check {
					name = "alive"
					type = "tcp"
					interval = "10s"
					timeout = "2s"
				}
			}

			# We must specify the resources required for
			# this task to ensure it runs on a machine with
			# enough capacity.
			resources {
				cpu = 500 # 500 Mhz
				memory = 256 # 256MB
				network {
					mbits = 10
					port "db" {
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

#Troubleshooting

##Networking
Nomad is a Docker scheduling tool and must communicate with agents and peers.  The simplest way to ensure 
that the Docker networking setup is not interfering with that communication is to use `host` networking.

##Configuration
The Nomad agent can run in either server or client mode and you need both on the network.  A configuration 
file loaded at start time controls the various aspects of the agent.  Here is an example file that is
configured to run an agent in server mode:

```
# -------------- General options ---------------

# Specifies the region the Nomad agent is a member of. A region typically maps to a
# geographic region, for example USA, with potentially multiple zones, which map to 
# datacenters such as us-west and us-east. Defaults to global.
region = "USA"

# Datacenter of the local agent. All members of a datacenter should share a local 
# LAN connection. Defaults to dc1.
datacenter = "data-center-one"

# The name of the local node. This value is used to identify individual nodes in a
# given datacenter and must be unique per-datacenter. By default this is set to the
# local host's name.
name = "server-one"

# A local directory used to store agent state. Client nodes use this directory by
# default to store temporary allocation data as well as cluster information. Server
# nodes use this directory to store cluster state, including the replicated log and
# snapshot data. This option is required to start the Nomad agent. 
data_dir = "/tmp/nomad"

# Controls the verbosity of logs the Nomad agent will output. Valid log levels include
# WARN, INFO, or DEBUG in increasing order of verbosity. Defaults to INFO. 
log_level = "DEBUG"

# Used to indicate which address the Nomad agent should bind to for network services, 
# including the HTTP interface as well as the internal gossip protocol and RPC mechanism.
# This should be specified in IP format, and can be used to easily bind all network services
# to the same address. It is also possible to bind the individual services to different
# addresses using the addresses configuration option. Defaults to the local loopback
#  address 127.0.0.1.
bind_addr = "127.0.0.1"

# Enables the debugging HTTP endpoints. These endpoints can be used with profiling tools
# to dump diagnostic information about Nomad's internals. It is not recommended to leave
# this enabled in production environments. Defaults to false.
enable_debug = false

# Controls the network ports used for different services required by the Nomad agent.
ports {
    # The port used to run the HTTP server. Applies to both client and server nodes. Defaults to 4646.
    http = 4646
    
    # The port used for internal RPC communication between agents and servers, and for inter-server
    # traffic for the consensus algorithm (raft). Defaults to 4647. Only used on server nodes. 
    rpc = 4647

    # The port used for the gossip protocol for cluster membership. Both TCP and UDP should be routable
    # between the server nodes on this port. Defaults to 4648. Only used on server nodes. 
    serf = 4648
}

# Controls the bind address for individual network services. Any values configured in this block
#  take precedence over the default bind_addr.
addresses {

    # The address the HTTP server is bound to. This is the most common bind address to change.
    # Applies to both clients and servers. 
#   http = "0.0.0.0"

    # The address to bind the internal RPC interfaces to. Should be exposed only to other cluster
    #  members if possible. Used only on server nodes, but must be accessible from all agents. 
#   rpc = "0.0.0.0"

    # The address used to bind the gossip layer to. Both a TCP and UDP listener will be exposed on this
    # address. Should be restricted to only server nodes from the same datacenter if possible.
    # Used only on server nodes. 
#   serf = "0.0.0.0"
}

# Controls the advertise address for individual network services. This can be used to advertise a
# different address to the peers of a server node to support more complex network configurations such
# as NAT. This configuration is optional, and defaults to the bind address of the specific network
# service if it is not provided. This configuration is only applicable on server nodes.
advertise {

    # The address to advertise for the RPC interface. This address should be reachable by all of
    # the agents in the cluster. 
#   rpc = "1.2.3.4:4647"

    # The address advertised for the gossip layer. This address must be reachable from all server nodes.
    #  It is not required that clients can reach this address. 
#   serf = "1.2.3.4:4648"
}

# Used to control how the Nomad agent exposes telemetry data to external metrics collection servers.
telemetry {
    # Address of a statsite server to forward metrics data to.
#   statsite_address = "1.2.3.4:5678"

    # Address of a statsd server to forward metrics to.
#   statsd_address = "1.2.3.4:5678"

    # A boolean indicating if gauge values should not be prefixed with the local hostname.
#   disable_hostname  = false 
}

# Enables gracefully leaving when receiving the interrupt signal. By default, the agent will
# exit forcefully on any signal.
leave_on_interrupt = false

# Enables gracefully leaving when receiving the terminate signal. By default, the agent will
# exit forcefully on any signal. 
leave_on_terminate = false

# Enables logging to syslog. This option only works on Unix based systems.
enable_syslog = false

# Controls the syslog facility that is used. By default, LOCAL0 will be used. This should
# be used with enable_syslog.
syslog_facility = "LOCAL0"

# Disables automatic checking for security bulletins and new version releases.
disable_update_check = true

# Disables providing an anonymous signature for de-duplication with the update check.
disable_anonymous_signature = false

# ------------- server-specific options ----------------------------- 
server {

    # A boolean indicating if server mode should be enabled for the local agent. All other server
    # options depend on this value being set. Defaults to false. 
    enabled = true

    # This is an integer representing the number of server nodes to wait for before bootstrapping. It is most
    # common to use the odd-numbered integers 3 or 5 for this value, depending on the cluster size. A value of
    # 1 does not provide any fault tolerance and is not recommended for production use cases.  
    bootstrap_expect = 3

    # This is the data directory used for server-specific data, including the replicated log. By default, this
    # directory lives inside of the data_dir in the "server" sub-path. 
#   data_dir = "/tmp/server"

    # The Nomad protocol version spoken when communicating with other Nomad servers. This value is typically not
    # required as the agent internally knows the latest version, but may be useful in some upgrade scenarios. 
#   protocol_version = 0

    # The number of parallel scheduler threads to run. This can be as many as one per core, or 0 to disallow this
    # server from making any scheduling decisions. This defaults to the number of CPU cores.
#   num_schedulers = 1

    # This is an array of strings indicating which sub-schedulers this server will handle. This can be used to
    # restrict the evaluations that worker threads will dequeue for processing. This defaults to all available schedulers. 
#   enabled_schedulers = "[]"

    # This is a string with a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "25m". Valid time units are "ns",
    # "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". Controls how long a node must be in a terminal state before it is
    # garbage collected and purged from the system. 
    node_gc_threshold = "6h"

    # When provided, Nomad will ignore a previous leave and attempt to rejoin the cluster when starting.
    # By default, Nomad treats leave as a permanent intent and does not attempt to join the cluster again when
    # starting. This flag allows the previous state to be used to rejoin the cluster. 
    rejoin_after_leave = true

    # Similar to start_join but allows retrying a join if the first attempt fails. This is useful for cases
    # where we know the address will become available eventually. 
#   retry_join = []

    # The time to wait between join attempts. Defaults to 30s.
    retry_interval = "30s"

    # The maximum number of join attempts to be made before exiting with a return code of 1.
    # By default, this is set to 0 which is interpreted as infinite retries. 
    retry_max = 0

    # An array of strings specifying addresses of nodes to join upon startup. If Nomad is unable to join with any
    # of the specified addresses, agent startup will fail. By default, the agent won't join any nodes when it starts up. 
#   start_join = []
}

#----------------------- client-specific options ---------------------
client {
    # A boolean indicating if client mode is enabled. All other client configuration options depend on this value.
    # Defaults to false. 
    enabled = false

    # This is the state dir used to store client state. By default, it lives inside of the data_dir, in the
    # "client" sub-path. 
#   state_dir = "/tmp/client"

    # A directory used to store allocation data. Depending on the workload, the size of this directory can grow
    # arbitrarily large as it is used to store downloaded artifacts for drivers (QEMU images, JAR files, etc.). It is therefore
    # important to ensure this directory is placed some place on the filesystem with adequate storage capacity. By default, this
    # directory lives under the data_dir at the "alloc" sub-path. 
#   alloc_dir = "/tmp/alloc"

    # An array of server addresses. This list is used to register the client with the server nodes and advertise
    # the available resources so that the agent can receive work. 
#   servers = []

    # This is the value used to uniquely identify the local agent's node registration with the servers. This can be any arbitrary
    # string but must be unique to the cluster. By default, if not specified, a randomly- generate UUID will be used. 
#   node_id = "foo"

    # A string used to logically group client nodes by class. This can be used during job placement as a filter.
    # This option is not required and has no default. 
    node_class = "experimentation"

    # This is a key/value mapping of metadata pairs. This is a free-form map and can contain any string values. 
    meta {}

    # This is a key/value mapping of internal configuration for clients, such as for driver configuration. 
    options {}
    
    # This is a string to force network fingerprinting to use a specific network interface 
#   network_interface = "eth0"

    # This is an int that sets the default link speed of network interfaces, in megabits, if their speed can not be
    #  determined dynamically. 
    network_speed = 100
}
```

A similar configuration is required to set up an agent in client mode.  If you are trying to set up clients and servers on
the same machine, you are going to have provide separate configuration files for each instance and change the ports that 
are being bound.
